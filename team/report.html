            <div>
                <strong>Purpose:</strong></br>
                To display photography in a gallery and provide information about product specifications, services
                offered, and contact info for the business. Another feature is for the customers to make an account so
                they can save items to a virtual shopping cart.
                </br></br>
            </div>

            <div>
                <strong>Data Description:</strong></br>
                <p>Table 1: Product Information</p>
                <p>This table will be used to store information about all the products. A user can click on one of the
                    photos and then be taken to a page with more information about the product (like Amazon, you can
                    browse images then click for more info), which will be retrieved from this table.</p>
                <p>Fields: primary key = product ID (int), product name (varchar), quantity (int), price (float),
                    dimensions (varchar), description (varchar), date taken (date)</p>
                </br></br>

                <p>Table 2: Customer Accounts</p>
                <p>The site can allow users to create an account so that they can save items to a shopping cart which
                    will be saved if they leave the site and come back later.</p>
                <p>Fields: primary key = email (varchar), first and last names (varchar), age (int), birthdate (date),
                    shopping cart (list of products they are considering buying)</p>
                </br></br>
            </div>

            <div>
                <strong>Functions performed by the app:</strong></br>
                <ul>
                    <li>On the gallery page: slideshow of some of the photography (for the header), then an arrangement
                        of all the available products below. Will also include buttons to sort the images based on
                        different features (ex. Sort by date or price)</li>
                    <li>Allow users to add items to their shopping cart (UPDATE to quantity in the database)</li>
                    <li>Allow users to create and then later update their account details (INSERT and UPDATE in the
                        database)</li>
                    <li>When displaying product details, information will be retrieved from the database (SELECT)</li>
                </ul>
                </br></br>
            </div>

            <div>
                <strong>Role of PHP and JavaScript:</strong>
                <p>PHP will be used to make SQL commands for updating the database. This will happen when the user
                    creates an account or wants to update their existing account (ex. changing a name or email address).
                    JavaScript will be used to update the gallery page when filters are applied. It will also be used
                    for the account creation for input validation (ex. Check for valid email addresses). When making the
                    site responsive, JavaScript might also be used for collapsing menus in a mobile layout.</p>

                <strong>Roles of Team Members:</strong></br>

                <strong>The increments:</strong></br>
                <p>For the first increment, we plan to create and set up the site and all the pages that we're going to
                    make. We also plan to start work on all the basic functionality of the site (adding images, create a
                    distinct style for the site).</p>
                </br></br>

                <strong>Client feedback:</strong></br>
                <p>The plan meets all the necessary requirements for the website, ensuring it aligns with the project's
                    goals. We plan to consult to with the client in more depth after we have prepared the first
                    increment.</p>
