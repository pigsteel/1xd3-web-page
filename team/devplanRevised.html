                <strong>Purpose:</strong></br>
                <p>
                    To display photography in a gallery and provide information about product specifications, services
                    offered, and contact info for the business. Another feature is a virtual storefront and a feature
                    for the customers to make an account so they can save items to a virtual shopping cart.
                </p>

            </div>

            <div>
                <strong>Data Description:</strong></br>
                <p>Table 1: Product Information</p>
                <p>This table will be used to store information about all the products. Both the gallery page and the
                    store page use SELECT to retrieve information from this table, since the images are displayed on the
                    page by getting the file name from the database.</p>
                <p>Fields: primary key = product ID (int), product name (varchar), <span class="blue">fileName
                        (varchar),</span> quantity (int), price (float),
                    dimensions (varchar), description (varchar), date taken (date)</p>
                </br>
                </br>
                <p>Table 2: Customer Accounts</p>
                <p>The site can allow users to create an account so that they can save items to a shopping cart which
                    will be saved if they leave the site and come back later.</p>
                <p>Fields: primary key = email (varchar), first and last names (varchar), age (int), birthdate (date),
                    shopping cart (list of products they are considering buying)</p>
                </br></br>
            </div>

            <div>
                <strong>Functions performed by the app:</strong></br>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Gallery/landing page: The main header contains the company name in one of the photographs being
                        sold. Below is an arrangement of all the products available (file paths are retrieved from the
                        database using SELECT). A user can click on any of the images to view it enlarged and then click
                        through all the photos like a slideshow.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Store page: The page is loaded with 5 product images, as well as their information (price,
                        quantity, etc). When the user scrolls to the end of the list, they can press a button to display
                        more products, whose information is retrieved from the database (using PHP/SELECT sent from
                        AJAX requests). There is also an option to sort the products by price or date taken. When this
                        order is changed, the displayed product list is cleared and replaced.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Shopping cart: For each product on the store page, there is a button for the user to add that
                        item to their shopping cart. Then on the shopping cart page, all the products added appear in a
                        table, and each one has a button allowing the user to remove it from the cart.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Login/Account page: Allow users to create and then later update their account details (INSERT
                        and UPDATE in the database). There is also an admin login which is to be used by the client,
                        granting them the permissions to add products and images to the site themself (without
                        programming knowledge).
                    </li>
                </ul>
                </br></br>
            </div>

            <div>
                <strong>Role of PHP and JavaScript:</strong>
                <p>
                    PHP/SQL are used to get the product info for displaying the products on the gallery and store pages
                    (SELECT). PHP will also be used to make SQL commands for updating the database when the user
                    creates an account or wants to update their existing account (ex. changing a name or email address).
                    JavaScript is used to make the slideshow feature on the gallery page (using event listeners to click
                    through the images and change which is enlarged on the screen in a loop). JavaScript is also used
                    to send AJAX requests from the store page, responding to button clicks to either show more products
                    or change the order. These products' information is retrieved using PHP and SQL. JavaScript will
                    also be used for the account creation for input validation (ex. Check for valid email addresses).
                    The mobile layout for the navbar also uses JavaScript to make the menu expand or collapse.

                <strong>The increments:</strong></br>
                <p>For the first increment, we set up the site and all the pages that we're going to make. We also began
